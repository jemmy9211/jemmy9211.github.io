Hello! I'm **Jemmy Chen**

## About Me

I'm a passionate software engineer and programmer who loves learning, specializing in computer science and information technology. This blog is where I document my learning journey, share technical knowledge, and life experiences.

Initially, I wanted to create this blog simply because I wanted to have a website with my own style where I could write about topics I'm genuinely interested in. I tried many blogging platforms and finally decided to use **Jekyll** to generate my blog, as it offers greater flexibility and allows for more diverse web page styles. But where to host the generated website? Do I need to set up a server? No, **GitHub Pages** provides me with a place to host my website, giving my wandering heart a safe place to rest.
